## Put comments here that give an overall description of what your
## functions do

## Creates and returns a "matrix" with
## named elements that are functions for
##  i)  getting the value of the matrix 
## ii)  setting the value of the matrix
##iii)  getting the matrix inverse
## iv)  setting the matrix inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Calculates the inverse of the "matrix" created 
## with makeCacheMatrix. First, checks if the inverse
## is available in the cache and if so returns the same
## otherwise calculates the inverse and sets it on the
## matrix.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
